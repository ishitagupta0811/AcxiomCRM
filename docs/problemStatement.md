3. Application Architecture 
The CRM application follows a layered architecture that separates presentation, application  processing, business logic, data access, database, and security responsibilities. This design is  technology-independent and can be implemented using different programming languages,  frameworks, databases, and deployment platforms. 
• Presentation Layer: Provides the user interface, screens, forms, dashboards, navigation, client side validation, and user interaction.  
• Application Layer: Handles application requests, service coordination, data transfer objects  (DTOs), validation, workflow orchestration, and communication between the presentation layer  and business layer.  
• Domain/Business Layer: Contains CRM entities, core business rules, calculations, workflows,  status transitions, business validations, and authorization-related rules.  
• Data Access Layer: Provides a controlled mechanism for storing and retrieving application data.  It contains database queries, data repositories, data-mapping components, and transaction  handling where required.  
• Database Layer: Stores persistent CRM data such as customers, leads, opportunities, follow ups, users, roles, activities, and audit records. The database should use appropriate  relationships, constraints, indexes, and normalization.  
• Security Layer: Provides authentication, authorization, password protection, session/token  management, access control, input protection, anti-forgery mechanisms, secure  communication, and other application security controls.  
• Cross-Cutting Services: Common services such as logging, exception handling, auditing,  configuration management, caching, notifications, and monitoring can be shared across  different application layers.

5. Validation Requirements 
AcxiomCRM shall implement validation at multiple levels. Client-side validation improves user  experience, but server-side validation remains mandatory because client-side rules can be  bypassed. 
5.1 Client-Side Validation — Required 
Validation  
Type 
Requirement 
Example
Required 
Mandatory fields must not be empty. 
Customer Name is required.
Email 
Validate email format. 
user@example.com
Phone 
Validate allowed phone pattern/length. 
10-digit Indian mobile format, if that is the  project rule.
Length 
Enforce minimum/maximum character limits. 
Name: configured maximum length.
Date 
Validate valid date and configured date rules. 
Expected Close Date.
Numeric 
Validate numeric format, range and precision. 
Opportunity Amount > 0.



5.2 Server-Side Validation — Mandatory 
• Repeat all security- and business-critical validations on the server. 
• Validate model state before database operations. 
• Validate foreign keys and referenced records. 
• Reject unauthorized record modifications even when a user manipulates browser requests. • Return user-friendly validation messages without exposing database internals. 
5.3 Business Validation Rules
Field/Area 
Rule 
Validation Category
Expected Close Date 
Cannot be in the past for an active Opportunity. 
Business validation
Opportunity Amount 
Must be greater than 0. 
Numeric + business  
validation
Probability 
Must be between 0 and 100 inclusive. 
Numeric + business  
validation
Follow-Up Date 
Cannot be earlier than today for a new/planned follow up.
Date + business validation
Email 
Must be present where required and follow valid email  format. 
Email validation
Phone 
Must follow the configured phone format and length. 
Phone validation
Required fields 
Mandatory business fields must be supplied before  save.
Required validation
Length 
Text values must remain within configured  
database/UI limits. 
Length validation



5.4 Recommended Validation Examples 
• Opportunity Amount = 0 → reject with: “Opportunity Amount must be greater than 0.” • Probability = 101 → reject with: “Probability must be between 0 and 100.” 
• Expected Close Date = yesterday → reject with: “Expected Close Date cannot be in the past.” • Follow-Up Date = yesterday → reject with: “Follow-up date cannot be earlier than today.” • Email = invalid format → reject with: “Enter a valid email address.” 
• Phone = invalid length/characters → reject with: “Enter a valid phone number.” • Required field blank → reject with a field-specific required message. 
• Text exceeds maximum length → reject before database save. 
6. Authentication & Security Specification 
6.1 Authentication Features 
Feature 
Requirement
Login 
Authenticate active users using approved credentials.
Logout 
Terminate authenticated session/cookie and redirect safely.
Password Hashing 
Use a strong adaptive password hashing mechanism; never store plain text.
Password Policy 
Enforce configurable minimum length and complexity rules.
Lockout 
Temporarily lock an account after repeated failed authentication attempts.
User Management 
Authorized administrators can manage user status and roles.
Authorization 
Use role and resource-level authorization for protected operations.
Audit 
Record authentication/security events without storing sensitive credentials.



6.2 Recommended Password Policy 
• Minimum length: 8 characters (or higher if the organization's security standard requires it). • Require a combination of character classes where appropriate. 
• Do not allow storage or display of plain-text passwords. 
• Do not log passwords, password hashes, reset tokens or authentication secrets. • Require secure password change/reset flows. 
• Consider preventing reuse of recent passwords if required by the project security standard. 
6.3 Lockout 
• Track failed login attempts. 
• After a configurable threshold, lock the account for a configurable duration. 
• Reset failed-attempt count after successful authentication according to the security policy. • Allow authorized administration/unlock through a controlled process. 
• Audit lockout and unlock events.
7. Role-Based Authorization 
The initial role model contains three roles: Admin, Manager and Sales Executive. Authorization  should be enforced on the server, not only by hiding navigation links. 
Role 
Access Scope
Admin 
Full application administration, users/roles, audit logs, configuration, all  CRM records and reports.
Manager 
Team/customer/lead/opportunity/follow-up management and  management reports; no unrestricted security administration.

16. Final Project Scope 
AcxiomCRM is defined as a role-based CRM application covering the complete customer-sales  lifecycle from lead capture through follow-up and opportunity management, with authentication,  authorization, auditability, validation, APIs and reporting. The project should demonstrate both  functional CRM capabilities and production-oriented engineering practices. 
The mandatory quality requirements are: client-side validation for Required, Email, Phone, Length,  Date and Numeric inputs; server-side enforcement of critical rules; business validation for  opportunity and follow-up dates/values; secure authentication; password hashing; password  policy; account lockout; role-based authorization; audit logging; and secured REST APIs.
17 Business Scenario 
AcxiomCRM is a web-based CRM application used by a sales organization to manage customers,  leads, opportunities, follow-ups, activities, sales pipeline, users and roles, and audit logs. Sales  users manage their assigned CRM records while managers monitor the complete sales pipeline  through a dashboard.

17.4 Authentication Database Requirement 
Do not create a custom password table for authentication. Use ASP.NET Core Identity for users,  password hashing, claims/roles, authentication cookies, password policy and lockout. 
• Use IdentityUser/IdentityRole or appropriately extended application identity classes. • Store only framework-managed password hashes. 
• Do not expose password hashes in MVC views, DTOs, API responses or logs.

• Customer Name is required and has a maximum length. 
• Email is required and must have a valid email format.

17.19 Final Acceptance Scenario 
1. Open AcxiomCRM without authentication → protected CRM pages must not be accessible. 2. Register/login with a valid test user → user reaches the Dashboard. 
3. Create a Customer with invalid email/phone → client-side validation appears and save is  blocked. 
4. Bypass browser validation with a crafted request → server-side validation still rejects invalid  data. 
5. Create an Opportunity with Amount <= 0 → rejected.
